I'm a developer.  I'm interested in many things, but on this blog will be writing primarily about XP, functional
 programming and leading agile teams.  I work at Unruly.


### The job of a programmer

The title of my blog is _The Job of a Programmer_.

***

_"The job of a programmer is to create 
languages which enable solving problems"_

***

This is a quote which I attribute to [Paul Graham](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programmer)). 
 I remember reading it in the preface to [Guy Steele]()'s book 
[Common Lisp The Language](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/util/html/cltl/cltl2.html) which inspired me when I 
was studying at 
college.  Neither the attribution nor the preface are real (according to the internet); they exist entirely in 
my mind. It goes to show how malleable 
human memory is when confronted with powerful ideas well presented.
